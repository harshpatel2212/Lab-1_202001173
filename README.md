> #### Q.1: Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.

### Functional Requirements:
1. The LIS system will enable the members to borrow a book or return it with ease while seating at his desk/chamber.
2. The LIS System also enables a member to extend the due date of his borrowing. They can re-issue the book if no other booking for that particular book has been made.
3. The System eases the work of library staff by handling the day-to-day book transactions in an optimized manner.
4. The librarian would have the administrative privileges and complete control over the system. 
5. He/She can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased and remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.
6. The User would have to register and make his account in the LIS system to use the members only features of the syste.
7. The User would have to login to issue any book, or to request or give suggestions about adding new books to the shelf.
8. The System would have a filter and search facilities through which they can filter out the books by the book name, author name, publising date, genre, and number of pages etc.
9. The system would also show similar books and the count of the available books in the database.
10. The User would get a profile page where he/she would be able to see his previous issue and return records. 
11. He/she would also get a recommendation of few books that he/she might like based on the previous books he/she would have searched for.
12. Non LIS member can preview the shelf and can even browse/search books online.
13. If user would also get a reminder email and sms 2 days before the due date of the issued book.

### Non Functional Requirements:
1. The website would be available inside the Institute LAN only.
2. The website should be made with the latest HTML5 technology
3. The users data should be properly encrypted and proper encrption mechanisms should be used for the confidential information
4. The system should be scalable and shoud be working in a auto-scale manner so that it is always functional in case of sudden increase in load in the website
5. The system should be portable i.e. it shoule be dynamic and responsive to any devices like mobile webpage, desktop webpage, etc.
6. The system should have a beautiful UI and it should be fast and the interface should be in a way that the user get a satisfactory user experience

> #### Q.2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

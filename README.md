> #### Q.1: Identify FRs and NFRs:
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.

> #### Ans:

### Functional Requirements:
1. The Library Information System (LIS) offers members a simple and efficient method for borrowing and returning books from the comfort of their own desk or chamber.
2. Members have the ability to extend the due date of their borrowed books and re-issue them if no other reservations have been made for the same book.
3. The LIS System streamlines the work of library staff by efficiently managing day-to-day book transactions.
4. The system gives librarians administrative privileges and complete control over its functions.
5. The librarian can add new records to the system when a new book is purchased and remove records if a book is removed from the shelf.
6. Users must create an account in the LIS system to access member-only features.
7. To borrow a book or make suggestions about adding new books to the collection, users must log in to the system.
8. The system provides advanced filtering and search capabilities, allowing users to search for books by various criteria such as book name, author name, publishing date, genre, and number of pages.
9. The system also displays similar books and the availability of books in the database.
10. Each user has a personal profile page where they can view their previous borrowing and return records.
11. Based on their previous book searches, the system provides personalized book recommendations for users.
12. Non-members can preview the library's collection and search for books online.
13. Users will receive a reminder via email and SMS two days prior to the due date of a borrowed book.

### Non Functional Requirements:
1. This website will be accessible only within the Institute LAN.
2. This website will be built using the latest HTML5 technology for optimal performance.
3. The user data will be securely encrypted, and appropriate encryption mechanisms will be used for confidential information.
4. This system will be scalable, with the ability to auto-scale to handle sudden increases in website traffic.
5. This system will be designed for portability, with a dynamic and responsive interface that can be accessed on various devices including mobile and desktop.
6. The user interface will be visually appealing, fast, and provide a satisfying user experience.
7. The database will be optimized for efficient management and smooth operation of the system.
8. Regular maintenance and updates will be performed to ensure that the system remains functional and up-to-date with the latest technological advancements.

> #### Q.2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

> #### Ans:

#### Scope:
1. The target audience of the mobile application is approximately 500 million individuals who suffer from hearing loss.
2. The system is not only intended for individuals with hearing loss, but also for users who would like to assist them, and these individuals are included in the user base.

#### Features:
1. The app features the ability to recognize sound events such as car horns and babies.
2. It provides immediate alerts to the user during these critical events.
3. The app is optimized to perform in real-time.

#### Non Functional Requirements:
1. The system is designed to be scalable and optimized for real-time performance on the Android platform.
2. Artificial Intelligence is utilized for optimal recognition of critical sounds for the user.
3. The system is a mobile application with low latency and optimized performance, achieved through the use of a large, non-hierarchical database.
4. User data is securely encrypted with appropriate mechanisms to protect confidential information.
5. The app is designed to provide a fast, effective and secure experience for the user.
